mkg3a is a tool to pack raw binaries into Casio Prizm .g3a (add-in) files.

== Quickstart ==

Build and install to /usr/local:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make install

== Compiling ==

Configure mkg3a with cmake, as in the quickstart.  Use cmake -i or your
favorite cmake UI (such as ccmake) to customize the configuration.

== Usage ==

Run mkg3a -h for help.

To build useful programs, you might do something like the following (requires
a GNU toolchain configured for sh4nofpu as well as crt0 and the g3a.lkr linker
script):

$ sh4nofpu-elf-gcc -c -o crt0.o crt0.s
$ sh4nofpu-elf-gcc -c -o myprogram.o myprogram.c
$ sh4nofpu-elf-ld -T g3a.lkr -o myprogram.bin myprogram.o crt0.o
$ mkg3a myprogram.bin
